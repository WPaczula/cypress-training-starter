# HOW TO ADD TYPESCRIPT

1. Install typescript via your package manager (for example npm) `npm i typescript`
2. Create tsconfig.json in the root - you can copy the one from this repo
3. Change .js extensions to .ts
4. Adjust `plugins/index.ts` to use TS exports
5. For custom commands add type declaration - see `support/commands.ts`
